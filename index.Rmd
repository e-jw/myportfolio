# **Elias Wilson**

I am a 21 year old Bsc Economics candidate at the University of Bristol and I am using this website to host some of my data analysis projects and examples of some econometric tools that I have learned and applied to a dataset. All of the work will be done in R.

## About

My interests include statistics, econometrics and applied microeconomics. I hope to pursue further education in economics after my undergraduate degree in order to develop a deeper understanding of econometric theory. 

My course at Bristol teaches me how to perform analysis on data using Stata, I then apply the concepts I have learnt using R.
