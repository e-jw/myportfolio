# **Elias Wilson**

I am a 20 year old Bsc Economics candidate at the University of Bristol and I am using this website to host any projects that I make or any econometric concepts I practice. 

## About

My interests include statistics, econometrics, economic growth and demography. 

I have been teaching myself the R programming language for over two years and I am familiar with the wide range of resources and the community surrounding R. My course involves, and has introduced me to, Stata and I hope to also further my understanding of this language. 

Studying econometrics means I focus on uncovering causal relationships and testing theory, however, I am also interested in, and read about, predictive modelling and machine learning.
